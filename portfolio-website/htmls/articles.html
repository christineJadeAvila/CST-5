            <p>We all are a product of our times. Our interests, achievements and 
                <br>expectations of the future happens in the context of the times we live in. 
                <br>Consequently, most of us don’t see beyond the present and even our <br>predictions 
                of the future are coloured by our present times. Occasionally, <br>there comes along a man or woman 
                who sees further than anybody else of <br>his/her generation. Alan Turing was one of them. 
                Though he was largely ignored <br>during his own lifetime and even perhaps hounded for his sexual 
                tendencies, <br>leading to his tragic death at a relatively young age his theories had such far 
                <br>reaching implications. It is difficult to imagine whether his universal computing <br>machine would
                 have been conceived by someone else if he had not done it. </p>

            <span>S. Karan | Jun 246, 2017</span>
            <p>Neural networks are set of algorithms inspired by the functioning of 
                <br>human brain. Generally when you open your eyes, what you see is 
                <br>called data and is processed by the Nuerons(data processing cells) 
                <br> in your brain, and recognises what is around you. That’s how similar the
                <br>Neural Networks works. They takes a large set of data, process the 
                <br>data(draws out the patterns from data), and outputs what it is.
