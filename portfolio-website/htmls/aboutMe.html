        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="about-me">I'm Christine Jade V. Avila, 20 years old. I like coding. 
            I started coding when I was 17. It all started when I am casually browsing YouTube and watched a vlog about side hustles, 
            and coding was mentioned as one of them. 
            However, it wasn't the kind of coding like programming, but rather encoding, but, still, after watching the vlog, 
            I googled about coding and wasn't really into it at first because it seemed difficult and challenging. 
            So, I ignored it for a few days. 
            <br><br>Then one day, while I'm cleaning the house, I turned on the TV and played random videos on YouTube.
            That's when I came across a video titled 'Don't Be A Programmer'. 
            I paused my cleaning and focused on watching the video. It was about being a programmer, a problem solver, a creator, an innovator. 
            The video is a partnership with IBM to talk about Call for Code a global initiative that calls developers 
            to build impactful and have a positive change across the world through their code. 
            After watching that video I wanted to be a programmer, and I started googling about how to become a programmer.
